Installation
===============================================

Formality is programmed to work standalone or
to be integrated with Kohana 3.x however with
minor modification Formality will work with any
php framework of your choice.

The Formality_Form is an abstract class which
requires a final wrapper to be implemented.

This allows final customisation of Formality to
nicely fit into any environment.


-----------------------------------------------

Standalone
===============================================

If you are using Formality as standalone,
all you need to do is include standalone.php
this contains hardcoded relative includes for
the required files.

Kohana 3.X
===============================================

There is a special class in the Kohana folder
called Formality.pjp This needs to be placed
in the classes folder along with form, field
and other classes.

CSS
===============================================

We have supplied some clean out of the box CSS
that should get you up and running.
